# About Me

This is a page about me. 

## Summary

To quickly summarize myself. I love everything there is about Data Analysis, Statistics, and Engineering. I try to develop myself into an individual that sits at the intersection of those three components. 

Data Analysis: I have focused on this during my MSc., analyzing the data from mathematical simulations. Since then I have worked at theScore, creating insightful results from their massive user base. In my personal time I typically resort to googling an open data-set to prove my point in any argument that data can solve.

Statistics: Besides the default amount of statistics taught in University courses, I am mostly self-taught. I've been passionate over learning every detail that can come up from work related statistics problems (Hypothesis testing, different probability distributions, simulated experience setup). As a result of this, I have a massive desire to learn more about statistics at both a theoretical and practical level.

Engineering: During my time as a Data Engineer, I have been exposed to the inner workings of a data ETL pipeline. As part of my administration duties, I've quickly learned to automate manual tasks. This has lead me to understand how to architecture larger systems in such a way that they can be both easily maintained and expanded in the future.
