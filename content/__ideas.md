Title: [draft] future post ideas
Status: draft
Date: 2019-03-25 8:23

post ideas:

1. President Game AI:
    * discuss the game and the test-driven developement
    * discuss the q-learning (and get some card-counting on the AI)
    * prove mathematically what the expected outcome could be based on probaility?

2. Hakuna Matata Analysis:
    * my FanTheory is that Scar lives by hakuna matata because he has "no worry" about the reprocussions of his actions. This would show the dicotomy between scar and simba when simba becomes king.
    * Prove this by doing text analysis on the scripts of the movie and lyrics of the songs?
        * essentially want to see if I can prove this without actually watching the movie

3. VGmusic analysis
    * Pull all midi from vgmusic.com
    * Convert them all into database repesentation of the songs
    * Do analysis on which "sections"/melodies occur most frequently in song
    * See if I can compare the metadata to determine which songs are the most popular indexed to the source game's popularity (ie from sales/rating/search results?)
