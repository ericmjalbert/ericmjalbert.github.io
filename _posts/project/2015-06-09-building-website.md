This is the start of my document on how I created this website.

For now I'm am just going to list things that I did while I'm actually 
creating this website.

1. I used Jekyll. I didn't use it for any specific reason, I just was spending
  too much time comparing the different frameworks and arbitrarily picked one.
2. Started with the [Jekyll Quick-start guide][1], and then followed with some
  more of the documents.
3. Wasn't make my desired progress, so later tried [another tutorial][2], which
  helped me create a very basic site.
4. Tried to upload the site to github-pages. Had some trouble but managed it 
  with `gem update github-pages`, found from [here][3]
5. Now I wanted to get some style, so I used the [Hyde][4] theme as a basis for
  which to design the site.
6. Took a while, but the main thing I wanted here was the neat sidebar. Now the
  problem is that nothing is aligned.
7. At this point I wanted to make sure my website would at least have my resume
  so I had to play around with adding that. I could get it to show nicely on a
  single html page so I decided to just put a link to the pdf. Oh well.
8. Cleaned up the style a bit and added a contact page. Now it's okay enough to 
  look at....
9. To be worked on later: 
    * A way to organize blog/projects by tags
    * A search bar
    * Change the format/style/font/color of the site to make it a little less 
      typical
    * Maybe some javascript stuff?
    * Add more projects and blogs....
