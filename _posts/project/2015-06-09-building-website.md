This is the start of my document on how I created this website.

For now I'm am just going to list things that I did while I'm actually 
creating this website.

1. I used Jekyll. I didn't use it for any specific reason, I just was spending
  too much time comparing the different frameworks and arbitrarily picked one.
2. Started with the [Jekyll Quick-start guide][1], and then followed with some
  more of the documents.
3. Wasn't make my desired progress, so later tried [another tutorial][2], which
  helped me create a very basic site.
4. Now I wanted to get some style, so I used the [Hyde][3] theme as a basis for
  which to design the site.
